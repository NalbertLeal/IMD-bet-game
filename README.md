### Introduction
  This project was suggested by the professor of UFRN/IMD Ivanovitch Medeiros. The idea is reinforce and practice the skills developed in the last class about python and numpy. The skills are:
  - loop
  - ramdom
  - numpy
  - list
  - functions

The project consist on the implementation of a game that have 2 dice and a builder. The builder have levels, we start on the level 0 (ground) and we go to the next level, if the number of the 1st dice (dice of 6 faces) is  3, 4, or 5, we go down if the number is 1 or 2 and we throw the dice again if the number is 6. But the 2nd dice have 100 faces, and if we getthe face 1 we go back to level 0. There's no level under the 0. There is 100 plays each round, and we going to play 500 times.
The professor want that we use: 

- Jupyter notebook
- python
- numpy
- git

### Inplementation

The implementation was pretty exciting using the "jupyter notebook", it's a great plataform to write code and comments. The problem was the numpy. It's a new structure that i never had used before, so was necessary read a little the numpy documentation. After i understood the numpy i had the code ready.
The output is into a file called "output.csv", it's not organized like i would like (rounds separated of each other) but i need to understand more about numpy type conversion to usual python types, because the only way i found to write the results to a file was using the function "tofile" that doesn't separete each subarray.
